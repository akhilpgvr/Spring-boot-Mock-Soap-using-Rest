SOAP is a protocol. so it follows its standard. It allows to communicate between client and server.
It uses only XML document for exchanging information between client and server.
It strictly takes XML as input file and XML as output file.
//
//
For REST API we can use Java Classes as well as Plaintext for exchainging information between client and server.
//
//
Soap is now mostly used for getting services from third party soap apis. For getting services from these apis, 
REST API needs to use these auto generated Soap java classes.
//
//
Simple Object Access Protocol(SOAP) is another type of API similar to REST api.
For soap api we have to generate Java Classes like request, responses, other dependent using XSD file.

First we have to create XSD file with all Class names and what all values included in Each Class.
After that these classes are used for creating API.
